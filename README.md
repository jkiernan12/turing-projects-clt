# TurTool üê¢

Turing School command line tool: open up front-end lessons and project specs.

## Description

Why spend five minutes doing something manually when you can spend five hours automating it? That was my mantra when working on this mini-project. I was sick and tired of searching for lesson plans and project specs, so I decided to waste a day writing a command line tool that did it for me. Of course, I had the pleasure of learning a little about command line libraries (Commander and Inquirer) and web scraping along the way. Maybe not a total waste of time???
